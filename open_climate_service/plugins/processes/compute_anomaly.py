"""Built-in openEO process: climate anomaly (observed − climatological normal).

Delegates the day-of-year/month alignment and subtraction to
``earthkit.transforms.climatology.anomaly``, which indexes the normal's ordinal axis
(``dayofyear`` 1..366 or ``month`` 1..12, auto-detected from the climatology) onto the
observed cube's datetime axis and combines them — so anomalies can be computed from an
already-published observed dataset and a published normal (see the ``climate_anomaly``
workflow). ``relative=True`` yields percent-of-normal.

The subtraction, the calendar indexing and the ``relative`` percent form are all earthkit's.
What this module adds is deliberately limited to two kinds of thing, kept separate so the
first shrinks over time and the second does not (see CLIM-859):

**Tracked upstream gaps** — delete once earthkit covers them:

- ``_match_spatial_grid`` works around exact-equality coordinate alignment.

**OCS policy** — ours to own, because earthkit is a general library and should not be
deciding our domain rules:

- refusing ``relative`` for temperature, an interval scale where percent-of-normal is
  meaningless;
- refusing an observed/normal temporal-resolution mismatch, which earthkit would otherwise
  silently resample.

    Observed and normal cubes can be produced independently (e.g. a CDS-derived observed vs
    an EDH normal whose longitudes were remapped from [0, 360)), so nominally equal grids
    may still differ by floating-point noise (~1e-11). earthkit's anomaly subtracts the
    climatology with plain xarray arithmetic, which aligns coordinates by **exact
    equality**, and it does not warn when that fails.

    Measured against earthkit-transforms 1.0.0: with 1e-11 of noise on a single row, the
    result keeps its full shape — a closing ``broadcast_like`` restores the dimensions — but
    every cell on the mismatched row comes back NaN. So the output *looks* structurally
    correct while silently losing data, and when the whole axis is uniformly offset (the
    realistic remapped-longitude case) that is every cell in the cube.

    This is therefore **coordinate normalisation, not resampling**: the axes must already
    describe the same cells (same length, same spacing, same positions to within
    :data:`_COORD_NOISE_RTOL` of a step), and then the observed coordinates are copied over
    so the arithmetic aligns. Anything larger raises and asks for an explicit regridding step.

    An earlier version reindexed by nearest neighbour within *half a grid step*, which is
    nine orders of magnitude more slack than float noise needs, and paired different physical
    cells without saying so: on a 0.1° grid, a normal offset by a full 0.1° came back shifted
    one cell with only a single NaN, so the anomaly was computed against the neighbouring
    cell for 9 of 10 cells while looking clean. A cell-centre vs cell-edge convention
    mismatch between two products is exactly that case.

    Upstream gap, not a preference: earthkit could either accept a tolerance or — cheaper and
    arguably better — detect the failed alignment and raise instead of returning a quietly
    NaN cube. To be filed against ecmwf/earthkit-transforms; delete this helper once it lands.

    A *regular* grid is assumed (true for the lat/lon and UTM grids this serves); the spacing
    check below is what makes that assumption explicit rather than silent.

    Only the x/y axes are considered. "Every non-temporal shared dimension" would also catch
    `bands`, whose labels are strings — the spacing check would raise
    ``could not convert string to float`` before earthkit ever ran — and axes like `quantile`,
    where numeric closeness has no grid meaning. Those align by ordinary xarray rules.

    Three things are settled before the numeric comparison, because each would otherwise make
    it meaningless:

    * **The CRS.** Coordinates are only comparable within one projection. Two UTM cubes an
      hour's drive apart carry overlapping eastings and northings, so identical numbers can
      describe entirely different places — UTM 45N against 44N passes every numeric check.
    * **Axis naming.** A normal on the same grid but naming its axes `latitude`/`longitude`
      shares no dimension name with an `x`/`y` observed cube, so nothing was compared and
      xarray broadcast the subtraction across all four axes: a `(10, 3, 3)` cube came back
      `(10, 3, 3, 3, 3)`, which on a country grid is thousands of times the memory for a
      meaningless result. Recognised spellings are renamed onto the observed cube's.
    * **Leftover dimensions.** Anything still on the normal that the observed cube lacks —
      and that is not the climatology's own ordinal axis — would broadcast the same way, so it
      is refused rather than silently multiplied out.
